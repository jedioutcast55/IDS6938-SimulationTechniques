 (b) Translate the mathematical formulas you now have into the df and exact.
       The code can be found in the Lecture6-Solution folder.  Output file can be found in "...Homework1/DocumentaionSupport/NumericalMethodDataFile.txt"

(c)  This is the code that I utilize to run the program to produce
	   RK1, RK2 and RK4, put the following results on a table.
	   Results can be seen in the following table:

(e) Vary the step size h = n, where you define three n valuse for x = <0.0, 10.0>.  I have selected the following values for n.

	 |h = n for n = 0.05|
	 |h = n for n = 0.5 |
	 |h = n for n = 1   |

Program results can be seen in "...Homework1/DocumentaionSupport/NumericalMethodDataFile.txt"

(f) Analysis of results:

	(1) Describe how varying the integration method changes the accuracy.
	By varying the different integration methods and take the error percentage (|exact – approx.|/ exact) we can
    determine which method is more accurate for a time step h = 0.1.

	(2) What happens as you increase the x value to the accuracy?
	As we can see from the error percentage graph, the error fluctuation increases and become for frequent and
    some have large magnitudes.  It is very obvious on the Euler methods for x <0.0-10.0), less so on the other
    two methods.  But you can still see it on the Midpoint, on the RK4 is very stable (at h=0.1).

	(3) How does varying the step size effect the accuracy?
	When a comparison of the RK4 method was taken with different time steps.  You can see that the higher the
    step (in this case h=1) veers away from the exact solution.  While the smaller the h is (h=0.05) much closer
	to the exact solution. In the graph presented RK4 for h = 0.05 cannot be seen as it is underneath the exact
	curve.

	(4) Which method is the most accurate and why (in particular explain what is taken to account in the solution)?
	The most accurate method is RK4.  RK4 utilizes a higher order differential equation the both the Euler’s and
    Midpoint methods.  RK4 option take into account the error more accurately than the other two methods.

    Part 2: Programming a Jello Cube
	- Forward Euler, midpoint integration, and RK4 - The following functions have been implemented on the jello cube
	  in File jelloMesh.cpp:
      Implemented JelloMesh::Euler()
      Implemented JelloMesh::MidpointIntegration()
      Implemented JelloMesh::RK4Integration()

	-  Particle forces other than gravity:                                                                                      The following function has been implemented on the jello cube in File jelloMesh.cpp:
	   Implemented spring forces in JelloMesh::ComputeForces(ParticleGrid& grid)

	- Collision and penetration detection.
	  The following functions have been implemented on the jello cube                                                           in File jelloMesh.cpp:                                                                                                   Implement JelloMesh::ResolveContacts(ParticleGrid& grid)                                                                 Implement JelloMesh::ResolveCollisions(ParticleGrid& grid)

    - Extra springs.                                                                                                           The following functions have been implemented on the jello cube                                                           in File jelloMesh.cpp:                                                                                                    Modify JelloMesh::InitJelloMesh() to add springs.

	- Implementing 2 features on the extra features list.                                                                       Different and more stable integration methods. Verlet, Velocity Verlet, Leapfrog, or                                     Symplectic. I have decided to implement two new enumeration methods.  These methods can be found in jelloMesh.cpp:       Implemented JelloMesh::Leapfrog()                                                                                         Implemented JelloMesh::VelocityVerlet()                                                                                   Implemented JelloMesh::VelocityVerlet()

    Part 3:                                                                                                                   1) What is the effect of the Ks and Kd parameters on the jello?
       As describer Ks is the elastic constant and Kd is the dampening constant.  Ks or the elastic constant is
       considered the stiffness of the spring.  The more stiffness is applied (Ks constant is larger) there is more of a
       bounce effect when forces are applied.  Kd as part of the dampening which reduces the time of the effect as Kd
       increases.  If Ks increases the jello cube tend to bounce faster, when Kd increase the time for which bounces
       reduces.

    2) What are the benefits and the drawbacks of the collision system used here? What are some different ways in which          it could be improved?
       -	This system uses a soft collision system, which provides a sprint force in the opposite direction when
            the particle hit beyond the object.
       -	The advantage is the algorithm can be easily implemented and would not produce.
       -	One disadvantage of the soft Collision system is that may look less realistic when interacting with the 
       -	surface as it will take some iteration to get above the object.
      -     A way to improve could be by increasing the time step on the integration method will reduce the amount of 
      -     error as well, however this comes at a processing penalty.

	3) What are some example systems you could model with Mass-spring simulations? Explain
       how you would you construct the model.
       As discussed in class the mass-spring there are a number examples of mass-spring simulations
	•	Hair
	•	Grass
	•	Fur
	•	Clothing
	•	Deformable shapes
    -	Similar as to what we do in the Jello cube. Produce a mesh like structure with the shape o of the object in
    -	question and then link them via structural, shear and bending forces.  The applying external forces when there
    -	are interaction with other objects.

    4) Does the jello behave realistically? What integration method did you choose to make the
       Jello stable?
       -	As for my simulation is getting close to behave realistically, but still there are some more refinements to
       -	make to as close to realism as possible.
       -	I use the RK4 integration method.  This method provides a higher order integration which reduces the error
       -	rate when compared to the exact solution.

    5) How would you model and simulate water (in terms of a continuous simulation)?
    I would use particle simulation.  In this case very similar to our current simulation.  Utilizing the fluid equation
    and provide a simple integral to be use with RK4.  The particles will be in contact with each other and when contact
    occurs the program will need to check for the forces and apply accordingly.  [1] Exploring the internet I saw a
    demonstration for Position Based Fluids which what it seem particle simulation in order to simulate water.
